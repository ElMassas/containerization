# Intro

## Goal

With this workshop you'll learn how to create and run, efficient and secure containers with the understanding of the pieces that make up the container space.
There will be a mix of knowledge sharing and exercises through every section of this workshop.

## Overview

Throughout this workshop we'll learn how to:

- Run an already existing container image

- Containerize an application

- Make a container image from scratch

- Run multiple integrated containers at the same time

- Create effective container images

- Different container engines and they're approaches

- Container networking and security

- Orchestration

## Requirements

For most of the workshop we will be using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), but we'll also experiment with [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md), [podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) and [nomad](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/install), so be sure to have these installed on your machine.

?> **Note:** For users doing this workshop on a windows machine, there might be some compatibility issues do to the requirement of an underlying Virtual machine.
